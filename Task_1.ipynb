    "### 4. The Diamond Problem and How Python Solves It\n",
    "The **diamond problem** occurs when a class inherits from two classes that share a common ancestor. Without a proper resolution order, the ancestor’s methods might be called twice or ambiguously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s MRO guarantees that the common ancestor is called only once and after all its derived classes. In the example above, `A` appears only once in the MRO, and both `B` and `C` are visited before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Potential Pitfalls\n",
    "- **Name clashes:** If two parent classes define the same method name, the one that appears first in the MRO wins. This can lead to surprising behaviour if you rely on both implementations.\n",
    "- **Complex MRO:** Deep inheritance hierarchies can make the MRO difficult to predict. Always check `__mro__` if unsure.\n",
    "- **Incorrect use of `super()`:** For `super()` to work cooperatively, all classes in the hierarchy must use `super()` consistently, even if they are at the top of the hierarchy (where `super()` calls `object.__init__`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Practical Use: Mixins\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is often used to create **mixins** – small classes that provide specific, reusable functionality. A mixin is not meant to stand alone; it is combined with a main class to add behaviour.\n"
